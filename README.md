We needed an app to address one of the the most important issues in our office – what’s for lunch? Following that, after our office was hit by a network outage in the morning that blasted productivity for unsuspecting early commuters we came up with the notion of a corporate announcements app. Something we could check to take some of the… surprises out of work. After polishing up the code, we realized it makes a pretty effective piece of sample code highlighting our Publish/Subscribe capabilities. Pull it down, customize and get everyone on the same page.
